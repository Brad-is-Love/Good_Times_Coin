            <h3>About</h3> 
            I’m Brad, AKA u/goodtimesbradtimes. I am the GTC team (with the exception of my wife who helps me 
            code sometimes when it gets too hard).
            <br /><br />
            <h4>Personal Career:</h4>
            My career started in ‘07 when I moved to Australia to take advantage of 
            the boom in the mining industry. Working up to 1km underground searching for nuggets of glory.
<br />
            When the industry collapsed in 2014, I moved back to New Zealand to assist my aging grandparents, working the floor in their rug factory. As orders came in, I would be the one to pull the rugs from the shelves and send them out to customers. All went smoothly until the global pandemic hit.
<br />
            Over the course of 18 months we became further and further indebted until the factory eventually closed. I searched high and low for a career that combined my unique combination of skills to pay back my grandparents’ debt. I landed on cryptocurrency.
            <br />    <br />
            <h4>Good Times Coin:</h4> 
            When I was a kid my parents used to joke: “Hard work pays off in the future, but laziness pays off now!”
<br />
            I suggested to my parents: What if we didn’t worry so much about the future and just made ourselves happy right now? Wouldn’t we always be happy? They dismissed it as childish stupidity, but I’m 34 now and realize I was right all along. That’s why I created Good Times Coin.
<br />
            Good Times Coin was created to address a global shortage of good times that has intensified in 2020 and 2021. Just remember that you can look at your GTC balance at any time, relax, and just give yourself permission to have good times.
<br />
            The power is YOURS!

            <h5>In All Seriousness:</h5>
            I bought my first little piece of Bitcoin as a secret santa gift in about 2016. And played online poker for Bitcoin through 2017-2018. Unfortunately I sold to fund my lavish lifestyle of affording to live in Auckland. But it led me to Harmony ONE in 2021, selling NFTs on DaVinci.Gallery.
<br />
            I fell in love with the functionality and community, learned to slap code together from online tutorials, and created Good Times Coin; a way to combine my love of good times with my love of cryptocurrency.
<br />
            I hope you have as many Good Times on this website as I had creating it.
<br /><br />
            Brad
