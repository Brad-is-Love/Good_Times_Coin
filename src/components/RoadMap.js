                    I want the Good Times to grow. 
                    I want people to stumble across this project and think "wow, some dude just gave me $10, $69, $420... of crypto. 
                    No strings attached."
                    <br /><br />
                    I want people who were here from the start to have $4,692 worth of GTC, by doing absolutely nothing
                    except having good times. <em>Just to prove that anything is possible and you don't even have to try.    </em>

                    dentures, or whatever they need to bring them good times.

                        <strong>Phase 2: The Good Times Store</strong><br />
                        The Good Times Store will sell all things that enhance good times, starting with ebooks. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Because the Good Times Foundation (me) will be holding GTC recovered through the Good NF Timers sale, I can break even on GTC sales and still make money by encouraging GTC use.
                        <br /><br />
                        Amazon charges a 30-65% commission on ebooks, which means we can charge 30-65% less, and still pay authors the same amount, if users pay with GTC. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Users can pay in dollars or GTC. The prices in dollars will be displayed alongside the much lower prices in GTC, 
                        which creates <em>The Gap</em>.

                    The algorithm controlling the product prices in GTC reduces the price as GTC rises, but doesn't increase the price if GTC drops.

                        <strong>For example:</strong><br />
                        Let's say today GTC is at $1. You want to buy a book that's listed for either $10 or 5GTC. You obviously choose to pay with GTC.
                        <br /><br />
                        Next week, the GTC price is $2. The book is now listed for either $10 or 2.5GTC. You choose GTC. I don't know why you want to buy the same book again, but whatever.
                        <br /><br />
                        There's a crypto market crash and GTC drops back to $1. But because the prices are locked from increasing, the book is still either $10 or 2.5GTC. 
                        </p>
                    </div>

                <p className="text-center">
                    This adds more upward price pressure if GTC drops, effectively creating a new floor.
                </p>
                <hr /><br />

                        <strong>Phase 3: Decentralisation</strong><br />
                        The Good Times Store code/payment gateway is made available to the masses, so that anyone can start their own Good Times Store, 
                        the algorithm controlling prices still produces <em>The Gap</em> between dollar prices and GTC prices, 
                        creating more upward pressure.

                    Successful stores will be rewarded with extra GTC, to incentivize growth.

                            <strong>Phase 4: Growth</strong><br />
                            As GTC grows, the stores will stock more and more products, day to day stuff like fruit and veggies. 
                            Charging unbelievably cheap prices, because even if some products are losing money, 
                            The value of the GTC stack grows faster than the money lost on any sales.

                    Eventually, we're selling boats, apartments, stadiums and quarries! GTC is widely accepted as the primary global currency. <br />
